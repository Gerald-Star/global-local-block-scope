    <h1>Global Scope- Local Scope and Block Scope</h1> 
    
    <div>
        
    <h2>Global Scope</h2>
    <p>The scope of a variable is its visibility; where in the code is the function available? Here is a list of the different scopes a variable can have.

        Global scope: The variable is available throughout the code

        <hr>
        task is to understand how adding var (and not adding) before a variable name, can change the variable’s scope.

         When you add var before the variable name, its scope is determined by where it is placed. Like so:     

    </p>


    <h2>Local Scope</h2>

    <p>Local scope: Available in only a certain area (like only within function)


    </p>


    <h2>Block Scope</h2>
    <p>
        Block scope: Available within an even more certain area (like an if-statement)

    </p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>When you add var before the variable name, 
        its scope is determined by where it is placed. Like so:</p>
    <br>
    <p>

        var num1 = 18; // Global scope <br>
        function fun() { <br>
        var num2 = 20; // Local (Function) Scope  <br>
        if (true) { <br>
        var num3 = 22; // Block Scope (within an if-statement)
  }
}

    </p>

    <h3>Variable declared without any var or scope. 
        It all becomes global scope.
    </h3>

    <h3>Example</h3>


    <p>
        When you don’t, this is the result:

        num1 = 18; // Global scope <br>
        function fun( ) { <br>
        num2 = 20; // Global Scope <br>
        if (true) { <br>
        num3 = 22; // Global Scope <br>
  }
}

    </p>
    </div>

        <h2>Local Scope and Functions</h2>
        <p> Variables which are declared within a function, 
        as well as the function parameters, have local scope.
         That means they are only visible within that function.
        </p>
    </div>

<h2>Global vs. Local Scope in same name Functions</h2>

    
It is possible to have both local and global variables with 
the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes 
precedence over the global variable.

In this example:
<br>


The function myFun will return the string Veggies because
 the local version of the variable is present.

<p> Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function.
A function can include the return statement
 but it does not have to. In the case that 
 the function doesn't have a return statement, 
 when you call it, the function processes 
 the inner code but the returned value is undefined. </p>
